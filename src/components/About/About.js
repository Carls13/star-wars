    Engineering student and Web Developer. I'm 21 years old. 

    I currently work as Full Stack Developer 
    at <a href='http://girosvenezuela.com' target='_blank'>
    GirosVenezuela</a>, where I've gotten experience 
    with Symfony (PHP framework), Docker, databases, WS and AngularJS. In my spare time, I make fun apps like
    this one.

    This app was made with ReactJS.
    It makes requests to swapi.co and recovers data about Star Wars planets,
    films and people. Please, make a stop and give them a support for 
    the project that it's pretty cool!

    In the design hand, I'm using the Tachyons library, making a lot 
    easier the components building. You can check it out, <a href='http://tachyons.io/' target='_blank'>
    right here</a>.
    I'll also leave you the link of <a href='https://github.com/Carls13/star-wars' target='_blank'>
    this project's repository on Github</a> (check the No-Redux branch,
      don't ask where the name came from haha)
    . If you have any doubt you can contact me and I will be glad to help
    you.

    I've also written <a href='https://link.medium.com/REMuE37JcU' target='_blank'>a Medium article </a> 
    describing a little the process of making this app.
     Check it out!
